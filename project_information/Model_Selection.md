Two regression models were implemented: Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor. These models were trained on the preprocessed training data using the scikit-learn library.
Linear Regression was chosen for its simplicity and interpretability. It serves as a strong baseline model that helps in understanding the linear relationships between features and the target variable. Random Forest Regressor was selected due to its ability to handle non-linear relationships, robustness to outliers, and higher accuracy in most real-world scenarios. By comparing both models, we were able to assess the effectiveness of a simple model versus a more complex ensemble approach.
