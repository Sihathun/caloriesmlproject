Working on this project gave me a clear, hands-on understanding of how to build a machine learning model from start to finish. I learned how important proper data preprocessing is—cleaning the data, handling outliers, encoding gender, and standardizing the features really helped improve the model’s performance.

After trying both Linear Regression and Random Forest, it became clear that Random Forest was the better choice. It handled the non-linear relationships in the data much better and gave a much higher accuracy (R² score of 0.9982). This shows how important it is to choose the right algorithm for the problem, not just the most basic one.

I also saw how tuning the model’s settings (like the number of trees or max depth) can make a big difference. This project helped me connect the dots between theory and practice, and gave me a better understanding of how to approach real-world machine learning problems.
