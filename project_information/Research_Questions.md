1. What is the goal of this project?
  The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the number of calories a person burns during a workout based on input features like gender, age, height, weight, duration, heart rate, and body temperature.

2. Why is this prediction important?
  Accurately predicting calories burned is important for individuals aiming to manage their weight, track fitness progress, or maintain a healthy lifestyle. Manual tracking or generalized calorie estimates are often inaccurate. A data-driven model provides more personalized, reliable, and efficient tracking, which can support better decision-making in health and fitness planning.

3. How is the model built and evaluated?
The model is built using a structured machine learning workflow: loading and exploring the data, preprocessing it through cleaning and standardization, splitting it into training and test sets, and then training two regression models which are Linear Regression and Random Forest. The models are evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error and RÂ² score, and the best-performing model (Random Forest) is selected based on its accuracy and reliability.
