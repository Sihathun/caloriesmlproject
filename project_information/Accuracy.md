In this project, we tested two machine learning models Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor to predict how many calories a person burns during a workout. We split the data into training and testing sets, using 80% to train the models and 20% to test how well they perform. The Linear Regression model gave okay results, but it couldn’t fully understand the complex patterns in the data. On the other hand, the Random Forest model worked really well. It had a very high accuracy, with an R² score of about 0.9982, meaning it could predict the calorie burn almost perfectly. It also had very low error values, which shows that its predictions were very close to the actual numbers. Overall, the Random Forest model proved to be much more accurate and reliable for this task, though it would still be a good idea to test it with more new data in the future to make sure it stays accurate.
