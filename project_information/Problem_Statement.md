Tracking calories burned during exercise is essential for monitoring physical health and achieving fitness goals. However, manually estimating calories burned is often inaccurate and time-consuming. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the number of calories a person burns during a workout based on biological and workout-related features such as gender, age, height, weight, duration, heart rate, and body temperature. By leveraging historical data and predictive modeling, the goal is to create a reliable and automated solution that can support personalized fitness and health tracking.
