In this project, we used a Random Forest Regressor to predict the number of calories burned based on biological and workout-related features. To optimize the modelâ€™s performance, several hyperparameters can be tuned. The most important hyperparameters include n_estimators, which determines the number of trees in the forest, and max_depth, which sets the maximum depth of each tree to control overfitting. Other key parameters are min_samples_split and min_samples_leaf, which define the minimum number of samples required to split an internal node or to be at a leaf node, respectively. The max_features parameter controls how many features the model considers at each split, with common values like "sqrt" or "log2". Setting bootstrap=True enables bootstrapping for sampling data, and random_state ensures reproducibility. These hyperparameters can be fine-tuned using methods like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to find the best combination that minimizes prediction error and improves generalization on unseen data.
